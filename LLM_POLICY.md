# LLM Policy

I do not use LLMs to write code in my open source projects, because I highly value
the ability to understand and trust the code that I write.

You can use LLMs to generate code in PRs, but if you generate an entire PR with an LLM,
I will probably reject it. Fully LLM-generated PRs tend to be very low quality and
it is a personal insult for me to spend time reviewing code that you did not spend time
writing, and do not understand. Understanding is the lifeblood of software
development and it's tedious to deal with code that has never been understood and people
who do not care about understanding.
