Hello!

I currently work on [Val Town](https://www.val.town/), building delightful serverless functions.
My open source work is related to geospatial problems. I've been an early employee
at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Observable](https://observablehq.com/),
[Config](https://config.com/), and founded [Placemark](https://github.com/placemark/placemark),
which is now open source.
