Hello!

I currently work on [Val Town](https://www.val.town/), building delightful serverless functions.
My open source work is related to geospatial problems. I've been an early employee
at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Observable](https://observablehq.com/),
[Config](https://config.com/), and founded [Placemark](https://github.com/placemark/placemark),
which is now open source.

I have [written a lot of stuff on my website](https://macwright.com/) which you can read.
I also have an [LLM policy](https://github.com/tmcw/tmcw/blob/main/LLM_POLICY.md) which you
can follow if you want to.
